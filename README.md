# FRACTAL BOOTCAMP: PRE-COURSE MATERIALS

Welcome to the study hub for **[Fractal Bootcamp](https://fractalbootcamp.com/)**.  
Below are two complementary learning tracks. You will need to complete the **pre-course prep intensive** if you want to feel comfortable on day 1 of bootcamp, so keep that in mind while planning your pre-course prep.

| Outline | Duration | Purpose | Best For |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Getting Started (An Introduction to Coding)** | 3 weeks | Curiosity-driven warm-up that blends animated explainers, Scrimba’s interactive lessons, and foundational readings. | Absolute beginners or anyone who wants a gentle ramp. This is a great and fun introduction to coding, especially if it intimidates you. |
| **Pre-Bootcamp Prep** | 0–4 weeks | Fast-track ramp-up that mirrors the pace of the bootcamp and the technical check-in. | Paced at approximately 2-4 h/day of focused work. |

> Many students browse *Getting Started* in the evenings while powering through the *Intensive* schedule during the day. Feel free to remix.

## Getting Started (An Introduction to Coding) — (3 weeks)

`NOTE: when learning to code, ALWAYS engage your curiosity. If you want to know why/how something works, ask ChatGPT, Youtube, or Google! (in roughly that order).`  

I encourage you to jump between resources, depending on what feels good in the moment:
- If you feel like actually DOING something with code, do the Practice.  
- If you want to learn concepts, focus on conceptual understanding.  

Enjoying and practicing coding before class is essential to get the most out of our bootcamp. The faster you develop an intuition for coding, the faster you'll fall in love with it as a medium of expression. There is a lot to learn here, but I guarantee you will not regret a second spent on learning to code after graduating from our program, because we will put every bit of your knowledge to work for you, and you will be rewarded for it.

*Why this sequence?*  
Full Stack Open gives modern project work, **Eloquent JS** sharpens language mastery, focused readings plug conceptual gaps, LeetCode seeds algorithmic thinking, and the “Other” column brings in Next.js—critical to the bootcamp stack.

### Instructions, Guidelines & Tactical Tips

* Branch off a feature branch (`git checkout -b your_name/module_name`), create `answers/your_name.md`, answer the questions, commit, push, and open a PR.
* Don’t copy-paste answers—explain concepts in your own words.
* Whenever you hit an unfamiliar term, jot it down and define it.
* Use the terminal as much as possible.
* Find a great resource? Add it to the repo and PR it—future students will thank you.
